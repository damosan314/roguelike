THE MAYOR SEES YOU APPROACHING AND
GREETS YOU WITH A "WELCOME HOME!"

HE CONTINUES...

YOU CAN VISIT THE INN TO GET A BITE 
TO EAT OR REST.  THE DOCTOR IS STILL 
HERE SO IF YOU NEED HEALING GIVE HER A 
VISIT.

WHILE HIS FLOCK HAS MOSTLY VANISHED THE
TOWN PRIEST WILL STILL PROVIDE 
BLESSINGS AND REMOVE CURSES.


LEANING IN MAYOR WHISPERS "AND OF COURSE 
THERE'S LEFTY...HE'S STILL OPEN."
