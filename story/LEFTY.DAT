LEFTY IS A FENCE.  WHILE TRYING TO
MAINTAIN A FACADE OF LEGITIMACY
EVERYONE KNOWS LEFTY PEDDLES STOLEN
GOODS.

HE DOESN'T ASK WHERE THE STUFF COMES
FROM AND HE DOESN'T ASK WHAT IT'S 
GOING TO BE USED FOR.  THE MAJORITY OF
THE TIME HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HE'S
SELLING.

YOU MAY BUY SOMETHING GREAT.  OR YOU
MAY BUY SOMETHING TERRIBLE.

GOOD LUCK!
