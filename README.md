A collection of "almost done" roguelikes using the LLVM-MOS toolchain for Atari 8bits.<br><br>

Built under Windows so modify B.BAT to match your setup.  The batch file will create three ATR images.<br><br>

  RL2.ATR - classic dungeon crawler<br>
  RL3.ATR - as above but using caverns<br>
  RL4.ATR - a "realtime" modern day zombie killing game using a joystick for movement.<br><br>
Feel free to use the code however you'd like.  There are some useful bits such as a small printf()/sprintf(), <br>
the beginnings of a VBI based sound library (in RL4), CIO code for fopen()/fclose()/fread()/fwrite(),<br>
a decent square_root() routine, etc.<br>

Have fun!
